ToDo
====

* Clean up tree
* Clean up tree code
* Ingredient links???
* Aliases
* Enforce glassware/units

aliases to work out:
* white rum -> light rum
* bianco-vermouth/white-vermouth -> blanc-vermouth (all of them)
* irish cream <- cream liqueur

Random thoughts from a while ago
* Search by drink name or ingredient
* "make me something" spin the wheel
* link and track multiple specs
* Collections (based on book, bar, something)
* ingredient categorries from upneat.rocks
* resolve specific vs generic
* spec.consturction enum [snken, stirred, other]
* auto-generate instructions?
