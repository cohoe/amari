ToDo
====

Code
----
* Move ingredient validator code from model to dedicated validator framework
* auto-generate instructions?
* Tests
* Split Search views of objects vs Database (parents not in DB but in Search)

API Functions
-------------
* Search by drink name or ingredient
* "make me something" spin the wheel

Data Model
----------
* Collections (based on book, bar, something)

Future Ideas
------------
Interactive drink builder. Start with a template, and swap out different
components. Split things, maybe some ML to make suggestions?
