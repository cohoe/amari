irish cream <- cream liqueur

aliases to work out:
* white rum -> light rum
* bianco-vermouth/white-vermouth -> blanc-vermouth (all of them)


Random thoughts from a while ago
* Search by drink name or ingredient
* "make me something" spin the wheel
* link and track multiple specs
* Collections (based on book, bar, something)
* ingredient categorries from upneat.rocks
* resolve specific vs generic
* spec.consturction enum [snken, stirred, other]
* auto-generate instructions?

Features
* Logging
* get_usable_ingredients in an expandable way
